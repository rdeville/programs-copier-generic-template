    For which CI system (Github Workflow, Gitlab CI, etc) to you want to install
    templates ?

    WARNING!!!
    For now, only Gitlab CI is supported.
    I may add Github Workflow later, but this is not sure.
    Feel free to contribute if you want to add your CI engine.
    I'll be glad to help
